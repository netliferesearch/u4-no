  "abstract": "This U4 Issue finds that resources are commonly subject to illicit extraction only to be integrated in legal value chains at various stages through e.g. forged certificates or by being mixed with legal resources. At the community-level, several attempts have been made to manage upstream risks in the value chain and to formalise the trade. The results have however been mixed and some initiatives – such as the Diamond Area Community Development Fund – have been criticised for actually contributing to increase inequalities. The authors find that a necessary starting point for these initiatives needs to be an in-depth understanding of power and incentive structures that uphold the current informal trade. \n\nIn order to address the shadow value chains, interventions are required at all levels: community, national, regional and international. The lack of transparency in the commodity trade in combination with low domestic regulatory capacity, and use of secrecy jurisdictions make shadow value chains a concern that require regional and international solutions. Commodity trading hubs such as Switzerland and the UK can take further steps to improve transparency in the commodity-trading sector and try to establish partnerships with natural resource-producing countries to more effectively monitor the trade. Read the paper for in-depth considerations and clues to potential interventions at all levels.",

These commodities often find their way to legal or illegal markets through what this paper has termed ‘shadow value chains’, meaning value chains that run, often in parallel, or intertwined with legal value chains. The paper argues that in order to limit the exploitation of natural resources for illicit and illegal purposes, more attention needs to be paid to the dynamics of the diverse value chains of these commodities. Such attention is required to avoid accepting unsupported assumptions at face value or relying on outdated evidence of links between natural resources and various forms of illicit and illegal activity. More importantly, and as this paper claims, in order to create better interventions, in-depth knowledge and understanding of local power relations and the incentive structures tied to these individual shadow value chains is crucial. Such knowledge should be paired with increased attention to how international actors and networks facilitate and accommodate illegitimate private gains stemming from West African natural resources.

Specific focus will be on corruption as an enabling/facilitating factor throughout the review. The focus on value chains stems from a ‘follow the money’ type of logic. It is also in accordance with the ongoing OECD Initiative for Policy Dialogue on Natural Resource-based Development, which recently produced a major typology of corruption risks in the extractive value chain (OECD 2017). The desk study will rely on, and combine, findings from empirically-related strands of literatures which not always speak to each other. These include the civil war literature, the terrorism literature, the poverty literature, the resource curse literature and studies within political economy, e.g. those on financial flows and corruption.

This often means that the evidence forms a poor basis for more general conclusions or, in the worst case, it might be unreliable. Accessing detailed data on how natural resources sponsor illicit activity may also be challenging due to the interest among law enforcement agencies not to publish detailed information on recent cases, e.g. of money laundering, as such information can be used by criminals to avoid detection. Therefore, the published case reports by, for example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are often generic and possibly not up to date with the latest developments in the modus operandi of money launderers. To avoid weak inferences, this paper has thus strived to search for those patterns that have been identified by more than one case study and which are (preferably) based on field research. In addition, findings are sometimes supported by information stemming from criminal cases, which provide additional insights into illicit transactions. Another methodological issue affecting this paper is the shortage of accurate estimates of illicit trade, which are key to grasping the magnitude of the problem. The available estimates are usually built on aggregates of interception rates (OECD 2016a), which makes them inaccurate, and the numbers should hence be viewed with caution. ",

The literature has come to no affirmative answer on this question, and depending on the conflict and context, both greed and grievance can be important factors (ibid). In light of this research, some important findings have emerged, for example, Lujala et al. (2005) found a positive correlation between lootable diamonds and conflict and that states with lootable diamonds are more likely to be involved in civil conflict than countries with diamonds that require sophisticated technology. This is in accordance with Ross (2002), who actually introduced the concept of ‘lootable resources’. On a macro level, however, factors such as increasing or declining commodity prices (Bruckner & Ciccone 2010), ethnic fragmentation/marginalisation (Caselli & Coleman 2013; Montalvo & Reynal-Querol 2005) and stagnant growth (Hoeffler et al. 2009) are all important factors in the resource-conflict nexus. For example, in Sierra Leone, the importance of diamonds as a motivation for engaging in fighting is somewhat mixed. Humphreys and Weinstein (2008) found that money and diamonds are important factors for engaging in conflict, and Miguel and Bellows (2009) found that war tends to be more intense in diamond-rich areas. However, Richards (2003) found that diamonds are not an important motivating factor on the individual level for engaging in conflict. Still, all of these studies on Sierra Leone agree that a mix of factors such as economic, social exclusion and social pressure bear significance in explaining armed conflict. ",

Research shows that rents can in fact have a stabilising effect by serving as a means to paying off/silencing opposition (Bjorvatn & Naghavi 2011) or maintaining political patronage and thus making sure that powerful actors gain from the status quo (ibid). This is especially effective in cases where resources generate large rent flows (Torvik & Aslaksen 2006). Acemoglu et al. (2010) found that rent-seeking governments had a choice between 1) maintaining a strong army and increasing the risk of a coup or 2) maintaining a weak army, which increases the risk of violent conflict. Thus, there is a link between natural resources and conflict, although there is debate on how strong this link actually is and on the causal factors that determine the circumstances under which conflict materialises in resource-rich countries (Niellsen & Bulte 2014).

Oil, gas, timber, diamonds and gold represent profitable sources of revenue and may also be appealing to terrorist organisations because of weak regulation in these sectors, low levels of detection, weak institutions in the countries where these resources are located and political instability in West Africa in general. However, few studies explicitly connect these resources to terrorist groups in the region. Studies focusing on the revenue sources of Boko Haram, Ansar Eddine, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), Al Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM) and other associated groups in northern Mali have not pointed to natural resources as one of their important sources of revenue, sometimes in contrast with assumptions and speculations (e.g. FATF-GIABA-GABAC 2016). There are, however, reports from intelligence agencies and security forces indicating that gold, diamonds and coltan may be illegally trafficked by regional terrorist organisations (ibid). There is some anecdotal (and often dated) evidence establishing a connection between Al Qaida and diamonds (e.g. Raphaeli 2003) as well as Hezbollah and diamonds (Levitt 2005a). However, most recent studies on this topic have found that the trafficking of drugs, humans and weapons, kidnapping, extortion, illicit smuggling of migrants, robberies and looting, etc. are in fact more important revenue sources for West African terrorist organisations (FATF-GIABA-GABAC 2016; Reitano & Shaw 2015; Lacher 2012; see also Smith 2014).

          "text": "Valuable natural resources have always attracted criminal syndicates and, as such, are linked to organised crime in two main ways. One is the structured and large-scale illegal extraction and trade in natural resources, which in itself, is an example of organised crime. Second, criminal organisations have used natural resources as a source of income or as a means to launder money (FATF and APG 2015; FATF 2013b). Still, natural resource-related crimes constitute an under-explored field within criminology. Green crimes are often regarded as more significant environmental issues than criminal issues, and traditionally, NGOs have devoted more attention to illegal resource exploitation than criminologists and law enforcement agencies (Boekhout van Solinge 2014). This means that NGOs are often at the forefront of producing updated empirical descriptions of the relationship between organised crime and natural resources (examples include the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime and Global Witness). Other types of organised crime, e.g. drug or human trafficking often coincide and coexist with organised natural resource-related crime due to weak governance structures that serve as enablers (Anig 2009; Reitano & Shaw 2015). Well-functioning networks developed for one type of illicit activity (e.g. in Nigeria and Mali) can often easily be adapted to new activities and new commodities (see, e.g. UNODC 2013). An example of such versatility is illustrated by the case of criminal groups in Peru and Colombia, which had long focused on drug trafficking, moving into artisanal gold mining when crack-downs on drug syndicates reduced the profitability of trafficking drugs to the USA (Global Initiative against Organized Crime 2016). However, as with other criminal activity, most empirical reports contain limited detail of how criminal syndicates operate within the natural resource sector, especially at the level of international organised crime. This tendency is clearly illustrated in the case of oil theft in Nigeria, where there is a substantial body of literature discussing the networks complicit in (more primitive) illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta (Obi 2010; Obi & Rustad 2011; Watts 2004; Bøås 2011). At the same time, there is a considerable shortage of knowledge of sophisticated oil theft, which is necessarily connected to supply chains regionally and internationally and which often involves states agencies.",

Previous research has often identified that criminal, insurgent and terrorist groups use different forms of corruption in order to access and trade natural resources (Kolstad, Søreide, & Williams 2008; Reed 2009, 2016). Contexts in which corruption is a systemic issue, anti-money laundering controls are generally weak, making it easier for criminal groups to integrate the funds generated from the illicit trade into the formal system (Kyriakos-Saad et al. 2012; Goredema 2011). It is thus well established in the literature that corruption plays a role as an enabler/facilitator in the access and trade of natural resources and that it enables criminal groups to launder the proceeds of illicit trade. An OECD (2014) review of 427 processed transnational corruption legal cases showed that 19 percent of the cases took place in the extractive sector. This makes the extractive sector one of the most corruption prone sectors overall (OECD 2014). The OECD (2016b) also recognised that it is not sufficient to focus solely on multinational companies and host governments to address issues within the extractive sector. The report called for an approach that tackles both supply and demand sides on a national, regional and international level in order to challenge corruption (ibid). ",

A similar trend is also emerging within the natural resource management literature where there has previously been a focus on transparency and technical solutions aimed at improving resource governance (Corrigan 2014; Humphrey et al. 2007). Parts of this literature have recently pointed to the need for more in-depth knowledge of local contexts. A suggested means to that end is political ecology analysis, which focuses on the relationship between political, economic and social factors in relation to environmental issues and changes (Williams and Le Billion, 2017). In terms of oil-related corruption in Nigeria, a range of detailed studies exist, including some recent ones (see, e.g. Sayne, Gillies, & Katsouris 2015; Sayne & Gillies 2016).",

As mentioned above, the literature is rife with examples of both petty corruption and more sophisticated or grand corruption in natural resource management in both developing and developed states. Corruption can be ad hoc or delimited, but in many developing countries, it permeates the governance of public resources and diverts these resources from public purposes for private gain. In order to devise sensible interventions to curb corruption and the illicit exploitation of natural resources or their proceeds, however, we need to move beyond acquiring knowledge of particular corruption plots and work to acquire knowledge of how corruption forms part of natural resource management (NRM) in each context in which interventions are intended. One of the most important conclusions of this report is that resource revenues emanating from diamonds, timber, gold and oil are critical to patronage networks and clientelistic structures in which state actors are deeply embedded. This has profound implications for the manner in which we study how these resources wind up funding illicit activities and why that is the case. It also has direct implications for how we understand corruption and the measures aimed at countering it. ",

Nigeria recorded the highest perceptions of corruption, followed by Sierra Leone, Malia and Liberia (Transparency International 2016). In the four country contexts, often referred to as ‘neo-patrimonial systems’, a system of real power and decision-making about natural resources tends to lie at least partially outside formal institutions (Cammack 2007). Instead, decisions are made by ‘big men’ and their cronies, most often a combination of state and non-state actors. These actors are connected and driven by a logic of personal and particularistic interest rather than the greater good of a population or state (ibid). These networks reach from the upper echelons of society (militant leaders, community leaders, members of parliament, chiefs, party officials, national bureaucrats) and down the chain to local clerks and security officers as well as villagers and criminal gangs (ibid). They also frequently include tribal leaders and international business actors. As such, these networks exist both outside of and are intertwined with the state. Some of these arrangements can be termed ‘informal institutions’ and function according to unwritten rules that are sufficiently systematic to be identified without being formalised (Kahn 2010). In order for these networks or institutions to work over time and become stable, the benefits must be consistent with the distribution of power among participants, which is where the role of natural resources comes in. Patrons maintain power due to the fact that they distribute resources (money, favours, valuable commodities, rents) and, consequently, have a constant need to access liquid resources such as cash or lootable commodities like diamonds, which can be easily passed between individuals and which patrons can distribute. Central to the understanding of neo-patrimonial systems is therefore an understanding of the distribution of power within these systems. Kahn (2010) refers to this as the relative ‘holding power’ of different groups and organisations contesting the distribution of resources; holding power is partly based on income and wealth and partly on the historically rooted capacities of different groups of organised crime.

As described above, they tend to be governed not by state institutions with the occasional corrupt feature but, rather, by political settlements encompassing a variety of actors with negotiated access to resources. The role of ‘the state’ within these structures may differ substantially, and state actors may play a variety of roles in such networks, often depending on their strength and interests in a geographical area or within a particular trade/industry. In states where state authority is patchy or weak, such as in the north of Mali, in the north of Nigeria or in the remote rural parts of Sierra Leone and Liberia, state actors may have only limited ability to project their influence onto peripheral areas, and other governing arrangements may thus dominate these areas. State control may therefore be a form of ‘negotiated compromise’ with local strong men (Reitano & Shaw 2015). In such instances, state actors may only control the main choke points of trade but may also play a significant role, especially by producing the relevant documentation or licences required to successfully export resources (ibid, 44). In other cases, such as in Nigeria, the state largely controls the oil sector, which in this case also means that the role of the state within these oil networks is even greater.",

Local state representatives are more often involved in smaller-scale operations or in processes related to customs clearance, immigration rule and tax collection (ibid). However, the benefits emanating from corrupt schemes are negotiated relative to their power and position within the network (Kahn 2010). As such, the role of state actors may range from facilitators and protectors to key players within such settlements. ",

The development of patron-client relationships began with the withdrawal of the colonial power, whereby ‘strongmen’ filled the vacuum left by colonialists (Bøås 2001). Leadership in Sierra Leone has historically revolved around ‘strongmen’ who provided for their network in order to maintain order, doing so with a mix of severe political violence and patronage (Christensen & Utas 2008). Historically in Sierra Leone, when the power of ‘strongmen’ diminished and leaders were no longer able to fend off competing factions, there was a high risk of political violence (Bøås 2001). This dynamic has been used to explain the outbreak of the civil war; as support for Sierra Leone dried up, so did resources for distribution in patronage networks, leading politicians to struggle to maintain both networks and stability (ibid). This tendency is also important for grasping the outbreak of the civil war as it brings a nuance to the previously popular and established picture of Sierra Leone and that the civil war was primarily about diamonds.",

As the civil war went on, other factions formed like the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), which later became an ally of the RUF (Keen 2005). An illustrative notion from the civil war were ‘sobels’, soldiers who fought for the SLA in the daytime and the RUF at night – soldiers at day and rebels at night (Keen 2003). This is just one example of a very intricate situation in which loyalty became difficult to determine and conflict a way of life. The lack of resources within government forces (SLA) made it considerably more attractive to join the rebels (RUF), who often engaged in looting and raids. ",

As part of the process, he granted himself and his key Lebanese advisor complete control of diamond mining (Maconachie 2009). The Lebanese minority in Sierra Leone have since established itself as a key player in the diamond trade. Under Steven’s 17-year rule, official diamond exports fell from more than two million carats in 1970 to 595,000 carats in 1980 and 48,000 carats in 1988 (Temple 2006).

In looking at the history of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone, it becomes clear that even before the civil war, there was very limited formalised governance of the diamond sector and that diamonds and other natural resources were used to build and sustain patronage networks or for self-enrichment.

Trade data from the International Trade Centre (ITC 2015a) show that 76 percent of diamond exports from Sierra Leone goes to Belgium, a famous diamond cutting and trade hub. The second biggest export destination for Sierra Leone’s diamonds is Mauritius, accounting for 8.7 percent of the trade. In total, Sierra Leone exported diamonds amounting to approximately USD$127 million in 2015 (ITC 2015a). As a way to make the diamond trade more transparent, the Sierra Leone government (2016) set up an online repository from where it is possible to track income generated from mining concessions as well as the holders of both large-scale (kimberlite) and small-scale (alluvial mining) diamond concessions.",

Mining constitutes an important source of income for the poorer rural population in Sierra Leone (Fanthorpe & Gabelle 2013). In order to improve the sustainability of both diamond mining and the diamond trade, the Sierra Leonean government created the Diamond Area Community Development Fund (DACDF) in 2001. The fund aims to correct the power imbalances within the diamond trade, redistribute resources and promote political stability (Maconachie 2012). The DACDF has, however, failed to deliver the expected outcomes, partly due to the prevalence of embezzlement and patronage in the distribution of benefits (ibid). In a review of community mineral beneficiation schemes, Dupuy (2017) identifies a lack of transparency in the allocation of funds and vague targets in respect of the funds as key issues limiting the utility of the DACDF. In addition, the DACDF uses the old chieftaincy system to redistribute benefits from the diamond trade, which means that old patronage structures and dynamics are allowed to live on in the current system. In addition to corruption issues, DACDF is at times criticised for having a destabilising rather than a stabilising effect. This is mainly due to issues with limited public participation in decision-making regarding the funds, which tends to reinforce existing unequal power relations (Maconachie 2012).",

There is a legal framework for alluvial mining in Sierra Leone, and small-scale miners can obtain licences (Levin & Gberie 2006). Diamonds from Sierra Leone more often divert at the point of extraction, close to its source, rather than later in the value chain. Miners and middlemen can, for several reasons, choose to trade diamonds illegally rather than using formal channels (Levin & Gberie 2006; Wilson 2011; Engwicht 2016). The motivation for choosing informal channels may be that they lack licenses for extraction, to avoid taxes, to achieve more lucrative prices on the informal markets or to smuggle the diamonds to a neighbouring country where the prices may be higher (Engwicht 2016). Wilson’s (2011) field study found that better prices in neighbouring countries was the primary reason for smuggling diamonds out of Sierra Leone. The diamonds are then integrated in the legal value chain in the country of exchange, for example, in Guinea (ibid). The field study also identified the lack of monitoring as a key driver in illicit mining and that government officials often know of the illicit mining but choose not to interfere because of kicks-backs/bribes.

To stop the revenue stream to the RUF and Charles Taylor, the UN sanctioned the rough diamond trade from both Sierra Leone and Liberia (UNSC 2000). Although the leaders from the civil war era, Charles Taylor (imprisoned) and Fonday Sankoh from the RUF (deceased), are gone, established networks and trade routes are likely sustained by former fighters and diamond traders (PAC & Global Witness 2008).

          "text": "Following the end of civil war, sanctions on Sierra Leonean rough diamonds were lifted by establishing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS). The KPCS is a certification process related to the place of origin of the diamonds to ensure that diamonds are ‘conflict free’. According to KPCS statistics, the members of the initiative control 99.8 percent of the formal global production of rough diamonds (KPCS 2016). If numbers are accurate, this should make the diamond trade fairly well regulated, although the KPCS has been criticised for its limited scope, which excludes human rights abuses, and that diamonds from conflict areas can easily be mixed with diamonds from non-conflict areas (Howard 2015). However, studies have documented several issues relating to the KPCS. Estimates from Vorrath (2014), for example, indicate that 50-90 percent of diamonds from Sierra Leone’s formal and informal small-scale mining operations are in fact not registered with the KPCS. Furthermore, large proportions of these diamonds are also smuggled out of the country according to the same report (ibid). In Sierra Leone, however, the KPCS was initially successful in limiting opportunities for the illicit diamond trade and in reducing revenue flows to the parties to the former civil war. Yet, a 2015 evaluation of the KPCS showed that while the formal export of diamonds rapidly increased in the years following the implementation (Howard 2015), the quality (carat) of the diamonds remained low. This raised suspicions that the high quality diamonds were still being illegally traded (ibid). Reports have also pointed to the lack of transparency in the diamonds valuation process (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists 2016). Companies can lower their export values to avoid taxes and shift profits externally (ibid). While the KPCS has established a set of regulations for the diamond trade both in Sierra Leone and globally, it has been struggling with the prevalence of fake export certificates, making it difficult for diamond traders to evaluate their authenticity (ibid). Resource traders may thus risk trading in conflict diamonds, even when they have followed the formal rules. ",

According to the study, the trade is formally illegal but socially accepted; and it is informally approved by supervising authorities like the police and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources. Engwicht (2016) found that Open Yai markets and middlemen have informal rules and honorary codes that traders follow. They also have collective funds for healthcare, weddings, funerals and elected chairmen. Middlemen facilitate the trade between diggers and high-end traders (both legal and illegal), and they arrange smuggling to neighbouring countries if the prices are higher or if a buyer prefers to make the deal in another jurisdiction (Levin & Gberie 2006; Engwicht 2016; Wilson 2011). According to Engwicht (2016), as well as other older studies, high-end traders are usually based in Freetown and are both foreign and Sierra Leonean (mostly from the Lebanese minority). Diggers and middlemen bribe officials to avoid a crackdown on the trade and can function relatively free of interference (ibid). In contrast to high-end traders who have licences and a wholesale approach to their trading, the Open Yai markets are an option for diggers – often young men who seek to profit from small-scale trading (Levin & Gberie 2006; Engwicht 2016).

An OECD report (2016c) on corruption in the extractives value chain also shows that the use of secrecy jurisdictions is a common global phenomenon in corruption cases in the extractive sector. One example of the use of secrecy jurisdictions in Sierra Leone is a Subsidiary of OCTÈA Limited, also known as Koidu Holdings, which holds a large kimberlite mining concession in Sierra Leone. According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), OCTÈA Limited accounted for 50 percent or more of Sierra Leone’s diamond exports, yet there is no data on how much the company paid in taxes. The agreement with the government states that OCTÈA Limited are subject to 35 percent tax on net profits. The company is located in a secrecy jurisdiction (British Virgin Islands), which makes it very difficult to access any financial data (ICIJ 2016). OCTÈA Limited was also ousted in the Panama Papers as being part of the controversial Israeli diamond trader Beny Steinmetz’ company group (ICIJ 2016). Steinmetz was later arrested over a bribery case in Guinea, where he is also suspected of money laundering (The Guardian 2016). The example illustrates not only that diamonds are potentially used for corrupt purposes but, also, the difficulty faced by the Sierra Leone government to generate the appropriate benefits from the diamond trade. It is important to note that Sierra Leone, as a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), is actively working on addressing beneficial ownership issues. In 2016, the government published a roadmap towards a public beneficial ownership registry for the extractive sector scheduled to become available in 2018 (EITI 2016a). ",

Bribery can be used to access the resource by paying officials to get a license to extract diamonds or to avoid interference in illicit extraction (Levin & Gberie 2006; Engwicht 2016). In the later stages of the trade, bribes/kick-backs may be paid to officials to access fake documentation or to smuggle the diamonds out of the country (Wilson 2011; Howard 2015; Engwicht 2016). Access to fake documentation facilitates the integration of illegally extracted diamonds to the legal value chain (Howard 2015). From a wider perspective, corruption plays a role in enhancing the prospects for criminal organisations to launder the proceeds of crime through the illicit diamond trade, as shown in the Swiss Leaks (ICIJ 2015). In addition, embezzlement and fraud limit the prospects of generating and distributing benefits from the diamond trade, as shown in the example of the DADCF (Maconachie 2012; Dupuy 2017) and the potential tax evasion case involving OCTÈA Limited (ICIJ 2016). This in turn forms part of larger systemic issues whereby exchanges of loyalty and favours take place outside the formal state system. ",

          "text": "There have been several attempts to curb the illicit diamond trade in Sierra Leone, such as the Kimberley Process, the DACDF and the EITI. Although these initiatives are directly aimed at targeting corruption, they all have components that are supposed to address corruption through certification, efforts to increase transparency as well as a more equal distribution of the benefits generated from the diamond trade. A Global Witness (2013) report on the timber sector in West Africa shows that permits have been abused by corrupt public officials. There are also reports of issues with fake Kimberley certificates in the diamond trade (Howard 2015). In addition, several reports also indicate that Sierra Leonean government officials are complicit in the trade and actively seek bribes/kick-backs (Wilson 2011; Howard 2015; Engwicht 2016). This can be partially explained by the fact that regulatory authorities like the police and the Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources lack resources in terms of salary and equipment (Levin & Gberie 2006; Howard 2015; Engwicht 2016). However, the government’s failure to address the informal diamond trade and to generate/distribute the benefits from the diamond trade suggests rent-seeking behaviour within institutions. This implies that there are more incentives for rent-seeking activities than the impartial delivery of services (Kolstad & Wiig 2009). To solve these issues, the underlying incentives for rent-seeking behaviour need to be addressed (ibid). ",

Dupuy (2017) has pointed out that introducing greater transparency can be part of the solution to overcome the issue with the DACDF. More transparency into DACDF funds can be particularly useful at the local level where the community has a direct interest in the funds being distributed more equally. At the national level, an online repository has been developed as part of the EITI framework, which enables media and civil society organisations to better monitor the licensing process in the diamond trade and extractive industry at large. However, as seen in the OCTÈA Limited case, companies can still avoid revealing potential beneficial owners and tax payments. In order for transparency to be effective, measures are needed to ensure that the data provided is accurate. In addition, there is a need for a strong watchdog, such as civil society organisations and independent media outlets. A recent review by Rustad et al. (2017) shows that there are mixed results from revenue transparency projects like EITI. In addition, Vorrath (2015) points out that there is lack of trust in international arrangements in Liberia and that local informal extraction often enjoys more trust in affected communities. ",

There is accordingly a need to better understand the incentives of the groups involved in this trade in order to design effective counter-measures.

Still, since alluvial mining and diamond trading are a source of revenue for many young men (Levin & Gberie 2006; Howard 2015; Engwicht 2016), if the informal sector is eliminated, there would be a need to find new sources of income for this group or to ensure their integration into the formal trade by providing economic incentives. Interestingly, in the absence of a formal regime, diggers and middlemen are already constructing their own redistribution channels and codes of conduct (ibid). These codes of conduct, unfortunately, do not include a ban on smuggling or the illicit trade in diamonds (Engwicht 2016), but there is probably a significant chance of eliminating some of the most harmful ways of trading by incorporating the group into the formal sector while still ensuring that the source of revenue does not disappear. To do this, there is a need for a better understanding of political economy and the interest/incentives of the stakeholders involved in the illicit diamond trade. ",

Diamonds have, as such, nurtured violence, corruption and the survival of influential networks that benefit from the illicit trade and, hence, will seek to retain a status quo. While diamonds are no longer directly funding conflicts in Sierra Leone, the findings in this paper indicate that the illicit diamond trade is still an issue in Sierra Leone, although it is not clear the extent to which it is used to finance organised crime and terrorism. In Sierra Leone, diamonds are easily accessible, and the fact that they often are extracted and traded outside supervision and regulation in an otherwise corrupt environment creates a risk that diamonds are exploited for money laundering, criminal activity and terrorist financing. Although the global diamond trade is regulated through the Kimberley Process, the system can be abused through forged documentation, used as a tool for integrating illicit diamonds into the legal value chain. This leaves diamond trading companies exposed, making it difficult to differentiate between legal and illicit diamonds. The illicit trade is facilitated by bribery whereby local officials are bribed to disregard the illegal extraction and trade. However, this is only one part of a governance system in which institutions fail to monitor and regulate trade as well as to generate and distribute the benefits from the diamond trade. The findings show that diggers, traders and state officials have economic incentives to engage in the illicit trade. To design effective interventions, the economic incentives need to be addressed in combination with the current power structures that benefit from maintaining the informal trade. Consequently, further in-depth analyses, such as political ecology or political economy analyses, are highly recommended before designing further interventions tailored to preventing diamonds from financing illicit activity on their way to consumer markets.",

Natural resources were seen by some as the root cause of war because it incited ‘greed’ (Collier 2000), while others saw the war as being motivated by ‘grievance’ related to the unequal distribution of natural resources (Ellis 1999). However, there are also alternative explanations to greed or grievance. The civil war in Liberia and Sierra Leone are not only connected because of geographical proximity and spill-over effects during the war; they are also connected because of a similar post-colonial neo-patrimonial rule that contributed to the civil war. Liberia suffered from deep problems with corruption, political violence and poverty (Utas 2003). These tensions, in combination with a weakened strongman rule, which was unable to maintain patronage networks, arguably contributed to the outbreak of the civil war (Bøås 2001).",

As such, all companies had to reapply for logging concessions (Beevers 2015). Johnson Sirleaf also inherited the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP), a major good governance programme with a budget of around $500 million, which constrained the government’s independence by placing external experts in key positions in government bodies (Reno 2008; Bøås 2009). The aim of the programme was to reconstruct the ‘failed state’ by providing funds and expertise and to limit official abuse of the system. GEMAP, in effect, put parts of the Liberian government under financial trusteeship to curb corruption for a limited period of time. Although the programme led to an immediate increase in government revenue, it proved unsustainable due to a failure to address the deeper social roots of corruption and because of its short-term focus (Reno 2008; Bøås 2009). Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, still president of Liberia, has proclaimed zero-tolerance against corruption. Under her rule, Liberia implemented several anti-corruption efforts such as the Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC), the General Auditing Commission, the Governance Commission, the Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS), the National Land Commission and the Public Procurement and Concessions Commission (PPCC) (U4 2012). The results of these initiatives are mixed. On one hand, they have created solid frameworks and institutions, but according Funaki and Glencorse (2014), many of these institutions struggle with effective enforcement due to issues such as bribery, nepotism, low salaries and lack of capacity. Enforcement is also criticised for being biased, only targeting out-of-favour politicians (Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index, 2016b). Johnson Sirleaf has also appointed three of her sons in senior positions with significant economic power (ibid), a sign that the country is still struggling with patronage and nepotism.",

The fact that China is the most important trading partner in timber exports can limit the EU’s influence over Liberia’s timber trade. Timber remains a key resource for Liberia, although the export pattern has changed, and it is doubtful whether the EU remains influential in the timber trade in Liberia. Exports to France, for example, decreased between 2011 and 2015 (Ibid).

          "text": "According to Gan et al. (2016), chainsaw milling is a large source of illicit tropical timber, primarily because it does not require sophisticated technology. Chainsaw milling operates at a low cost but cannot supply timber on an industrial scale; thus, it is often used to supply the domestic market (ibid). A recent study by Bickel and Cerutti (2017) shows that domestic informal chainsaw milling is larger than official timber exports. Domestic informal chainsaw milling provides low quality timber for local construction, carpentry and furniture making (ibid). According to the study, local informal chainsaw millers have short supply chains without sawmills involved; thus, prices are low, and there is little added value to the primary product. Importantly, not all chainsaw milling is illegal, and there is in fact a legal framework for it in Liberia (Bickel & Cerutti 2017). It is therefore possible to get licenses for chainsaw milling under Regulation No. 115-11 administered by the Forest Development Authority (FDA) (FDA 2012). However, domestic informal chainsaw milling is not properly regulated, and a lack of understanding of potential economic gains from trading outside the domestic market limits the potential for economic growth related to timber (ibid). In contrast, Kishor and Lescuyer (2012) argue that illegal global timber traders are more sophisticated and have the resources to transport and launder illicit timber in the global supply chain.",

The FDA also gave concessions for 10 million hectares of forest, even though the total amount of forest in Liberia at that point was 4.5 million hectares (ibid). This shows that the FDA had given the same concessions to several companies. The FDA’s inability to control and monitor land concession thus frequently creates issues with contested land ownership due to there being several actors holding a claim to the same land. It also creates conflicts between communities and companies over contested land concessions (Beevers 2016).",

Bribery is important for ensuring non-interference in the illicit trade, which applies to both the illicit trade in timber and in other types of illegal trade, such as the drug trade (Vorrath 2014). Bribery can also be used by illicit traders to access fake documents and licences like PUPs. Bickel and Cerutti’s (2017) study on informal chainsaw milling in Liberia found that in order to avoid state interference, informal taxes were paid to government officials, and bribes were frequently paid to police officers at checkpoints. A documentary by Global Witness (2016) showed that the British company Sabel paid bribes worth close to $1 million to key actors close to President Johnson Sirleaf, including one of her sons, for the rights to a large iron ore concession. This is an indication that corruption still plays a role in natural resource management. It also reveals the existence of rent-seeking behaviour whereby politicians and government officials seek to extract bribes or other forms of ill-gotten gains from the natural resource trade. This tendency goes beyond the occasional bribery, and in order to address corruption, there is a need to better understand the underlying incentives and structures that lead to rent-seeking behaviour (Kolstad & Wiig 2009).

Such projects might give rise to what has been called 'isomorphic mimicry', whereby the government implements reforms and sets up oversight that function like a façade, mimicking good governance, with marginal effect in reality (Pritchett et al. 2013).

Beevers (2015) argues that the current forest governance interventions in Liberia were built on pre-civil war arrangements that were used for corruption and patronage, like the Chieftaincy system in the DADCF. Reforms aimed at addressing corruption in the timber sector have, according to reports, also failed due to a lack of ‘political will’ (Beevers 2015; Funaki & Glencorse 2014; Global Witness 2013). However, to state that lack of political will is the reason for the limited impact of anti-corruption reforms in the timber sector falls short of pinpointing the essence of the problem. In order to properly address corruption, there is a need to spend resources to unpack the black box of lack of political will.",

This enables illicit traders to avoid prosecution as well as to access resources and licences/certifications that they have no formal right to access. Domestic informal chainsaw milling seems to play a significant role in the timber trade, but this paper found no evidence connecting it to organised crime or terrorism. However, the prevalence of fake certificates and issues regarding hacked databases are worrying and indicate that logging companies may be complicit in the illicit trade. The poor track record of forest governance interventions in Liberia shows that there is a need to better understand the underlying power structures and incentives that uphold the current system and the underlying incentives of stakeholders who engage or facilitate the illicit trade.

One of the reasons for the sharp dip may be a ban that the government enforced on artisanal mining during rainy seasons in order to reduce accidents and to divert people back to agriculture. Another reason seems to be that there were crackdowns on artisanal mining sites located within permits held by large mining companies (Reuters 2015a).

In fact, it works so well that it also attracts substantial amounts of ASM gold from neighbouring countries like Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire (PAC 2017). The porous borders of the region, the favourable application of tax laws in Mali, along with geographical concerns, have thus contributed to the establishment of Bamako (along with Ouagadougou to some degree) as an export hub for artisanal gold (ibid). There are also other indications that smugglers transport foreign gold to Mali to be illicitly exported from there. According to a calculation carried out by PAC, the UAE reports to have imported an amount of gold from Mali that exceeds some of the more conservative estimates of total gold production in Mali. According to the calculation, Mali produced 45.8 tonnes of gold in 2014, while the UAE reported to have imported 59.9 tonnes of gold from Mali that same year (PAC 2017).",

Local refiners carry out the refining. One of them, the Kaloti Group, claims to account for close to half of all refining in Dubai’s gold market (Bowers 2014). Actors like the Kaloti Group then redistribute gold via the international gold market or sell it at the souk, either as jewellery or per gram. The transaction from exporter or smuggler to buyer in Dubai often proceeds with no documentation requirements and is paid for in cash. In an inspection carried out by Ernest & Young Dubai, the Kaloti Group was found to have bought gold from ‘walk-in’ customers on a large scale. The average walk-in would carry about 2.25 kilos of gold, while the maximum amount recorded was 35 kilos (Bowers 2014). According to Ernest & Young’s conclusions, the value of the company’s cash-for-gold deals amounted to $5.2bn in 2012, compared to the $6.6bn worth of transactions involving conventional bank transfers. The same inspection also found evidence that large amounts of undocumented gold that had been smuggled via Morocco was traded by the same company at the souk (ibid), illustrating that the Souk functions as a hub for legally and illegally traded gold.

Other sources claim that as of 2010, only 150 sites were actually active (Schipper et al. 2015). Precisely because illegal mines operate clandestinely and fail to abide by labour laws, the workers employed in informal or illegal mines are on average vulnerable to different forms of labour exploitation (Verité 2016). Child labour is banned by law in Mali (HRW 2011), but it is nevertheless socially widely accepted (Schipper et al. 2015), and an estimated 20 percent of artisanal miners are children. Children who migrate without parents are particularly vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation (HRW 2011) and are easily exploited as sex workers in mining areas. The pre-financing schemes described by PAC in Mali may as such facilitate workers in becoming indebted to patrons and being locked in debt bondage schemes (see e.g. UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery 2016). On a general basis, one can say that artisanal gold mining attracts some ethically questionable practices such as child labour and prostitution and is, in general, often associated with human rights abuses (UNICRI 2016).

Several general characteristics of gold and the gold market make it particularly enticing to criminal actors. One is the nature and size of the gold market itself, which is highly reliant on cash as a method of exchange. In fact, much of the international gold trade operates ‘off the books’ (UNICRI 2016), and cash for gold outlets flourish around the world. Another convenient characteristic is the anonymity generated from the properties of gold, which make tracking its origins very difficult. Gold is also a reliable medium of exchange as its weight and quality can be assured; gold prices are fixed in markets worldwide; and both the demand and the value of gold tend to be relatively constant (Cassara 2016).",

This can be explained, at least in part, by the observation that in Mali, models of power and politics have carried over from pre-colonial and colonial times to the present (Murray 2016). Rampant corruption, clientelism and rent-seeking behaviours at all levels of society compromise the quality of state institutions and characterise the way in which the Malian state manages its resources, foreign donor funds and business relations. In public procurement processes, economic stakeholders are commonly bribed in exchange for competitive public offers (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2017). Not unlike many other neo-patrimonial systems, patronage, informality and corruption thus characterise the way in which society and governance work. In the northern part of the country, government officials serve as protectors and facilitators of activities by accepting a share of the profits (Reitano & Shaw 2013). ",

The Malian state has done little to formalise the ASM sector, or to close loopholes in legislation, which allows the illicit flow of gold to continue. Mali amended its Mining Code in February 2012, but there is still little de facto control over the actors managing the ASM sector. As a result, the exploitation of the mining sectors outside the legal corridors continue without authorisation or traceability (PAC 2017), leaving the impression that the activity is informal yet ‘protected’. Mining licenses and informal permission for government officials to operate as tax collectors, organisers, buyers, etc. around artisanal mining sites are also likely to function as rents in a larger and deep-seated clientelistic system. This system may affect the priorities of law enforcement institutions and perceptions of what is considered serious criminal offenses. An IMF inquiry, e.g. found that investigative authorities, especially the police, the gendarmerie and customs services had few means and little tradition for investigating sophisticated economic and financial crimes in Mali. Instead, the perpetrators of such crimes were often lumped together with ‘respectable persons’ (IMF 2015), which indicates that there are also cultural or habitual reasons for the prevalence of corruption and economic crime in Mali.

The export tax is only charged for the first 50 kilos of gold, which means anything above that amount can be shipped without paying taxes (PAC 2017). The Malian government has taken no steps to close the loophole despite concerns expressed by some neighbouring countries. Lenient tax regimes and a lack of political will to formalise the ASM gold sector are not proof of corruption in themselves. Still, this leaves sufficient leeway for networks of gold smugglers to operate, a favour which usually does not come without rewards and a distribution of gains in neo-patrimonial orders such as Mali’s.",

Analyses of financial flows elsewhere exemplify how illicit financial flows tend to perpetuate and exacerbate informality in the artisanal gold mining sector (GIATOC & Estelle Levin Ltd. 2017). Particular characteristics of gold and the gold market also contribute to its utility for IFFs and rent seeking, which also create a resistance towards the formalisation of the sector, especially from those actors profiting downstream. The informality of the sector does, however, come at a price to artisanal miners upstream, as the endeavour is closely associated with environmental damage, human trafficking, child labour and prostitution, including child prostitution, as well as a general disregard for human rights and international labour standards. This study has not been able to verify that Malian gold is associated with criminal networks, militants/insurgents or that it is used for money laundering, probably partly due to the difficulty of following the disguised ‘gold trail’. Still, the value chain of ASM gold, and the export system in particular, certainly represent opportunity structures that could potentially be used for money laundering, with relatively low chances of being prosecuted. This means that there is a considerable risk that gold exported through these channels is associated with illicit activity in Mali and elsewhere. Mali has made progress in terms of transparency measures (EITI 2015), but as long as the country is in a state of conflict, the measures taken are likely to be minimal. Perhaps somewhat contrary to expectations, the lack of transparency is seen particularly in relation to the industrial gold mining sector. This may also stem from the fact that there is increasing attention drawn to ASGM from actors and organisations engaged in detecting human rights violations in the artisanal mining sector. However, this attention has yet to be translated into concrete action by donors and policymakers. ",

It also negatively affects socio-economic development and supports a range of other types of international organised crime in the GoG. The low oil refinery capacity of Nigeria’s four refineries is also costly for the Nigerian state, as it creates a situation in which Nigeria imports most of its fuel and resells it to its citizens (until 2016) at subsidised prices.",

Networks of workers operate onshore, in swamps or in shallow waters to siphon oil, using hoses to load the oil onto barges. The barges then transport the crude through the Delta and onto small tankers waiting at the coast. The tankers may carry the cargo to a refinery or storage tank elsewhere in the Gulf or simply to a local storage facility. Once there is enough oil, it is transferred to a larger coastal tanker or an international class ship waiting further ashore. This vessel will then either be filled from scratch or be topped up by the illegal oil, thus blending legal and illegal product. Most of these larger tankers are chartered for oil export and hence transport the oil to destinations outside the country (Katsouris & Sayne 2013).",

While co-loading and split cargo are not illegal per se, they can be exploited as a way to disguise illegal oil (Katsouris & Sayne 2013). Stolen oil can also be transferred ship-to-ship at sea. Due to the shallow waters of Nigeria’s port draughts, lighter vessels are needed to transport oil closer to shore. Thus, such transferals are not uncommon even with legal oil.

Irrespective of the precise motivation, not only have these groups and loosely organised militia benefited significantly from organised oil theft, they have also benefited from government campaigns to stop illegal bunkering in the Delta. A government amnesty programme promised immunity from prosecution and financial and educational support towards finding alternative livelihoods for militants. Some 26,000 militants turned themselves in, among them, some prominent leaders (UNODC 2013). The amnesty allowed oil production to rise from about 700,000 bpd in mid-2009 to about 2.4 million bpd in 2011. However, the programme was costly as it offered monthly payments to ex-militants totalling about USD$500 million per year.

In mid-2015, violence resurfaced with detrimental implications for local residents in the Delta states as well as for international oil interests, shipping companies operating in the Delta and the federal government of the newly elected President Bukhari. The government has since launched a military counter-offensive both on land and at sea, however, this offensive is reportedly of limited success (Onuoha 2016). In the 2017 budget proposal, Bukhari’s government proposed to restore the financing for the amnesty programme to pre-2016 levels to about USD $215 million (Bloomberg 2017). Somewhat ironically, both oil theft and the political measures designed to stop oil theft can be said to sponsor the Delta militant leadership.",

Some of the vessels were attacked almost 100 nautical miles from the coastline (International Maritime Bureau 2017), suggesting well-planned attacks and that pirates are in possession of rather seaworthy vessels. A notable trend was also that kidnap for ransom against merchant vessel crews increased significantly in these waters. Thirty-four crew were taken in nine separate incidents in 2016 in Nigerian territorial waters (IMB 2017). Some have suggested that kidnapping for ransom at sea should not be seen in isolation but, rather, as ‘an extension of the land-based kidnappings’ typically performed by Delta militants (Hastings & Phillips 2015).

In these types of large-scale and highly organised attacks, the actual pirates only play a detached role as ‘muscle’ in a larger syndicate of financiers and brokers, politicians and international actors (Hastings & Phillips 2015). Stolen oil thus appears to fuel different types of maritime piracy and criminal networks operating at sea. However, oil in general, and the presence of the international oil industry in particular, appears to be pivotal in attracting many of these attacks. ",

Unconfirmed reports claim that East European, Russian and Asian organised crime networks reportedly play a role in the international part of the value chain of stolen oil (Katsouris & Sayne), but details are sketchy. The literature on oil theft is thus rife with claims which sometimes appear to amount to mere rumours of how stolen oil benefits criminal networks. What can be established is that there are high risks that trafficking networks that manage sophisticated illegal supply chains may also be implicated in other types of illegal activities, such as oil theft. Overall, however, there is little proof of the connections between oil theft, insecurity and TOC (Katsouris & Sayne 2013).

However, several studies also point to the key facilitating role played by law enforcement agencies, in particular, the Joint Task Force (JTF) (Katsouris & Sayne 2013; Pérouse de Montclos 2012). The involvement of the JTF is key since it is, in fact, especially tasked with patrolling for evidence and the seizure of perpetrators, vessels and equipment used to steal oil in the Delta states (Katsouris & Sayne 2013). Rent-seeking police and member of the army are also complicit by protecting oil theft networks for a cut (Pèrouse de Monclos 2012). In addition, there are claims that local employees of the oil industry are complicit (Vreÿ 2012) and that politicians or government officials in some cases oversee the practice (Gillies 2009). Bribes thus appear to be a common facilitating tool in terms of small-scale oil bunkering.",

The beefed-up Nigerian anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has, for example, arrested dozens of public officials and their cronies (The Economist 2016) and cut the number of passive middlemen that profit from oil sales (Sayne & Gillies 2016). The management of the NNPC oil sales has also improved slightly under Bukhari, after having worsened in the years prior to his tenure (especially between 2010 and 2015) (Sayne, Gillies, & Katsouris 2015; Sayne & Gillies 2016). There has also been improvements in NNPC reporting, which means that small steps have been taken to improve transparency in the opaque NNPC (Sayne & Gillies 2016). The top brass of the NNPC was also sacked in 2015 (Kazeem 2015). Still, several problems persist, such as the NNPC spending billions of dollars that it could not account for. In the last half of 2015, i.e. under Bukhari’s rule, only a third of the NPPC’s oil sale revenues were transferred to the national treasury, meaning that the corporation withheld a 10 percent higher share in that period than in 2013 and 2014 under Goodluck Jonathan (Sayne & Gillies 2016). While some of these funds are most likely spent legitimately, corruption is found to explain at least part of the missing funds (ibid). The NNPC thus appears to be a key vehicle for diverting the proceeds of oil in Nigeria. Nigeria has however made progress according to the requirements established by EITI, and the overall assessment is that Nigeria has made ‘meaningful progress’ in terms of improving the public debate and ‘satisfactory progress’ in collecting ‘in-kind revenues’.",

The above analysis shows that oil is stolen at most levels of the value chain in Nigeria. It also shows that various forms of corruption, including bribery, embezzlement and document forgery are instrumental in the relentless occurrence of theft and fraud. In addition, it shows that as oil and oil products reach the point of export and later, import, corruption evolves into large-scale embezzlement and fraud schemes, often carried out through complicated operations to create confusing and complicated paper trails. These lucrative schemes involve the NNPC, local Nigerian companies, politicians, Nigerian elites as well as foreign traders and often subsidiaries located in tax havens. These schemes are criminal in their own right, but this report has found little evidence to support that they subsidise other illicit or illegal activity such as terrorism, militancy and drug smuggling.

Resources with a high value density, such as diamonds and gold, are naturally more attractive for illegal or illicit artisanal extraction than resources with a lower value density and are thus extracted illegally on a small scale. The paper found no evidence of industrialised-level illegal diamond and gold extraction, but the lack of such information should not be interpreted as proof that it does not exist. Instead, more research is needed into the gold industry in Mali and the diamond industry in Sierra Leone to determine whether gold and diamonds could also be diverted from the value chain flowing from the formalised sectors. In the case of Nigerian oil, it is not illegally extracted; rather, it is stolen after one of the multinational oil companies has extracted the mineral. Theft happens both on a small scale within the Delta (i.e. close to the point of extraction) and on a larger and highly organised scale inside and outside the Delta, at several stages of the value chain, both near to and far from the point of extraction.

This is to say that it is part of the informal economic sector (Engwicht 2016; Bickel & Cerutti 2017; the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, GIZ, & Estelle Levin Ltd. 2017). Informal extraction is often driven by poverty and economic incentives due to lower transaction costs or higher prices in the informal and illicit trade (Wilson 2011; Bickel & Cerutti 2017). The artisanal mining industry in Mali is mainly informal, and so is a large part of the timber trade in Liberia and the diamond trade in Sierra Leone. This means that both of these particular value chains represent a chance for poor people to make a living, but they also serve as sources of income for corrupt officials and present a potential for money laundering and/or exploitation by criminal groups.

Timber is sold in informal domestic markets or smuggled out of the country using fake certifications or by hacking timber databases. Diamonds and gold are smuggled out of their respective countries, sold in illegal markets, used for money laundering schemes or exported trough informal channels, as is often the case with ASM gold in Mali. This paper finds that corruption also plays a role in accommodating the informal trade, sometimes due to the lack of enforcement of the limited regulation that actually exists. In fact, often times, there is no shortage of regulations, but partly due to the availability of rents and the weakness of the formal system as such, there is a lack of incentive to enforce those regulations. In Nigeria, there is no shortage of regulation; rather, the regulatory system is bloated and often times made too complex to navigate. In such a context, where the formal and informal systems work in intertwined ways, most of the stolen Nigerian oil appears to be sold illegally in regional or international markets through various complex, fraudulent arrangements, often necessitating the complicity of corrupt high-level government officials, politicians or sophisticated document forgery, as in the case of potentially hacked timber databases (Global Witness 2017a; Lawson & MacFaul 2010). Smaller amounts of stolen oil are also sold in illegal markets locally in Nigeria. As oil is neither particularly value dense or easy to smuggle, common to all types of oil theft is the involvement of networks of actors, including people functioning as ‘muscle’, government officials, elites and politicians in order to protect and facilitate the endeavour.

The paper also found that higher demands on supply chain control, in combination with interventions aimed at promoting licensing, may have led to a new market for forged licenses. One example of this is the abuse of Private Use Permits in Liberia, whereby bribes are exchanged for permits. In Nigeria, there seems to be intricate schemes for document forgery that appear to enable both grand theft- and grand corruption related to oil. ",

In Nigeria, for instance, small companies found to be involved in illegal storage and transportation, as well as oil fraud schemes, are often owned by government officials or politicians (Hastings & Phillips 2015). Both beneficial ownership structures and the existence of tax havens thus play a key facilitating role in the large-scale looting and diversion of natural resources. The lack of due diligence on behalf of traders who import these resources further enables both large-scale and small-scale looting as well as the illegal and illicit exploitation of natural resources from West Africa.",

Importantly, however, the absence of evidence in this paper should again not be interpreted to mean that there are no such links. Organised crime seems to be more closely intertwined with the trade in lootable resources, especially because high-value resources such as diamonds and gold are attractive for money laundering purposes (although such money laundering is not documented in this study). Nonetheless, it should be noted that several studies have concluded that high-value resources like diamonds and gold carry a particularly high risk of being exploited to launder money (FATF 2013a; Engwicht 2016; Hunter & Smith 2017). A forthcoming U4 ND Public Eye study (2017) also shows that the commodity trading sector lacks strong anti-money laundering requirements and that FATF recommendations are mainly applicable to financial institutions. Yet, using commodities for money laundering falls under a larger trade-based money laundering concept, which has been identified by Global Financial Integrity (2015) as the largest source of illicit financial flows from developing countries. This suggests that more attention ought to be devoted to West African countries and their development donors. ",

The fact that large shares of these commodities are traded partly outside of formal market structures makes them vulnerable to exploitation by criminal networks and armed actors, such as militants, pirate syndicates and terrorists. In neo-patrimonial systems such as these, where resources are governed both by formal and informal institutions, often in complex interaction, corruption becomes crucial and widespread. This means that corrupt practices facilitate natural resource theft; but perhaps more worrying is that it facilitates opaque market structures which in turn leave room for a wide variety of illicit private gains. Not only does this deprive local populations of the benefits of natural resources, it also breeds more corruption, the hollowing out of state institutions, nourishes shadow economies and secrecy jurisdictions and helps hide and wash the profits stemming from other criminal behaviour. These structures may also constitute convenient avenues for clandestine organisations seeking to undermine state projects and law and order, such as regional or global terrorist networks. Rent seekers and criminal exploiters of natural resources often use ingenious methods and work out sophisticated systems of how to carry out their operations undisturbedly. Making sure that a lucrative set-up is not interrupted or impeded necessitates a certain distribution of benefits to a variety of actors, including political elites, law enforcement personnel and members of the judiciary. The fact that natural resources are exploited in ways that ensure that large networks profit, to some extent, is not only a core characteristic of neo-patrimonial networks, but also what makes devising effective countermeasures complicated. This is why this paper insists that in these types of governance systems, interventions be tailored in accordance with intricate understandings of the value chains. Interventions that fail to take profit patterns and structures into account may risk that value streams simply mutate to accommodate new obstacles, that established networks find ways to capitalise on these new obstacles by acting as gatekeepers, that efforts and interventions become irrelevant and hence contribute to fatigue on the part of donors or, worse still, on the part of local stakeholders and societies.",

Considering that the natural resources looked at in this paper lend themselves well to illegal exploitation, there is little reason for optimism what concerns the chances that gold, diamonds, timber and oil are not exploited by terrorists. The lack of clear evidence may be ascribed to the vexing challenge of mapping and understanding these purposefully opaque networks. ",

Instead, both illicit and illegal natural resource exploitation continues much to the benefit of the few. The four countries included in this study in fact go a long way in representing near-ideal conditions for exploiters of natural resources, as they are characterised by low risk and high potentials for profit. More precisely, they are characterised by porous borders, deficient state monopolies on the use of violence, often deficient territorial control, weak law enforcement structures and endemic corruption. These factors enable illicit, or partially illicit value chains, which in turn bring natural resources onto the market place. These findings are important for economic, development and security reasons. Quantitative research shows that countries where officials steal natural resources have higher incidences of rebellion and violent crime (Katsouris & Sayne 2013), which means that poor resource governance in West Africa is also real obstacle to peace and security. In states that are in some form of ongoing conflict, such as Mali and Nigeria, criminal networks often choose to support antigovernment or terrorist groups in order to prolong or sustain the very conflict environment which enables their own predatory activities (Deville 2013). This may have grave consequences for stability, but also for the prospects of a viable state able to provide rule of law. In addition, shadow value chains also require protection, which in many cases leads to increased levels of criminal violence.",

Recognizing that shadow value chains of natural resources transcend individual state boundaries and that international actors play crucial roles in these value chains, successful countermeasures should not address the local parts of the value chains only, but action needs to be tailored to all stages of the value chain. Adding to that generic recommendation, the next section will provide some modest suggestions that may be relevant when designing interventions to diminish the exploitation of lootable natural resources and to curb the corrupt networks that facilitate and gain from this activity.

          "text": "In the type of governance systems described in this paper, traditional policy recommendations focusing on support for law enforcement agencies, licensing schemes and establishing accountability measures will often times only have limited effect (Booth 2012). At worst, they will have detrimental effects as they may serve to reinforce rather than weaken the neo-patrimonial networks involved. There is also empirical evidence suggesting that placing increased demands on governments can cause more effective clientelist relations rather than foster good governance (Booth 2012). By channelling money into state structures which are themselves associated with informal exploitative networks, donors may unintentionally help create opportunities for innovation and the further persistence of these networks. A weakness of some of the approaches that aim to build stronger accountability is that they do not necessarily build on context-specific understandings of corruption (Johnsøn, Taxell, & Zaum 2012). This has sometimes led them to the assumption that anti-corruption interventions will succeed if they can strengthen the abilities of the authorities to monitor and hold agents accountable for their actions. Such approaches often take for granted that the principals themselves have no political will or incentive to establish a transparent system (Marquette & Pfeiffer 2015, 2). In contrast, state actors who rely on natural resources to uphold or build patronage networks usually have few incentives to effectively regulate the trade unless it coincides with personal gain. In order to devise sensible interventions, we need to develop a better understanding of the intricate dynamics, including the state and non-state actors involved in governing and exploiting the resources at hand. To do so, we need to pay attention to the underlying distribution of power and patronage, track changes to it and try to understand the sources of power at play (Kahn 2012). This is, however, no simple task as power tends not to be distributed once and for all, but to be continuously renegotiated. This requires not only outside intelligence efforts, but also local insights and knowledge of the dynamics at hand. Even though gathering such information is both resource demanding and complicated, and despite the fact that powerful networks may also be willing to use a range of means to protect their interests (Reitano & Shaw 2015), such insights are key to unpacking the oft-cited black box of ‘lack of political will’, which is often an important explanatory factor in failed reform attempts.

          "text": "In each of the four countries studied in this issue paper, corruption represents the norm rather than a deviation from an ideal type of governance system. This suggests that corruption is not only part and parcel of the illegal lootable resource trade, but most likely also part of the legal trade in these resources (although this has not been sufficiently demonstrated in this paper). As shown, for example, in the case of diamonds in Sierra Leone, corruption is part of a workable system with informal rules and regulations. To design more effective natural resource management interventions, there is a need to understand the actors involved, their incentives and how their networks function. A few donor agencies already have frameworks for political economy analyses, such the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (2013), power analyses and DfID’s Driver of Change analysis (DfID 2009). These frameworks, however, do not go as deeply into the links between political, economic and social factors in relation to environmental issues and changes as the political ecology analysis recommended in Williams and Le Billion (2017). They nevertheless provide a starting point for thinking about how to produce ‘thick’ contextual descriptions and a greater understanding in order to devise sensible and tailored interventions. This type of analysis is also in line with a point made in the 2017 World Development Report, which stresses the need to recognise power distributions in policy arenas before designing policies, as these power relations may affect policy design and implementation (World Bank 2017). Gaining a more holistic understanding of local power distributions and patronage systems does not, however, imply that sweeping reforms or interventions addressing corruption at all levels of society should or could be designed. In fact, according to Khan et al. (2016), research shows that corruption interventions with a sectoral approach have greater prospects of achieving change. In addition, taking the OECD’s mapping of corruption risks along extractive value chains into account could help identify entry points for intervention. This should include scrutiny of the part of the value chain that involves international actors as they are often times closer to the consumer point of the value chain. Consequently, a point of departure for the design of interventions seeking to address the illicit trade in natural resources in any country could be to focus on a specific sector, with particular attention paid to highly exposed points of the value chains, based on a comprehensive contextual analysis.

An increased awareness of the gravity and unfairness of the system can be created by sharing political economy analyses with ordinary citizens (Cammack 2007). By displaying how values are stolen, how much is diverted from state coffers and exploited for private gain by elites, local communities may gain a better understanding of local informal power structures and how they undermine development and democracy (ibid). These types of political economy analyses can however be highly controversial and can potentially cause security concerns or societal unrest. Provided that considerations are made regarding whether this could potentially impact local stability, making available information on corrupt practices may thus also inspire the intelligentsia, media, NGOs and others to engage in peaceful rights activism, which could help strengthen weak civil society structures and help improve the potential for community engagement initiatives. Such measures should however be cognisant of the fact that one of the reasons that corruption goes mostly unpunished is that it is not necessarily perceived as a dysfunctional system but rather one that works according to a different logic (Cassara 2016; Cammack 2007). Interventions should thus recognise that all forms of corruption are not necessarily perceived as deviant or illicit but, rather, as ‘business as usual’ and that it may even form part of long-established norms. They should also reflect that in societies characterised by widespread corruption and patronage, civil society often has limited capacity to mobilise. ",

The results of these community-based initiatives are mixed, and they often become highly political, with limited community influence. One way to ensure the utility of these community initiatives is to make them inclusive not only in terms of consultation but also in actual design and possibly even redesign. This is also in line with the suggested approach to more effective governance interventions according to the ‘thinking and working politically’ paradigm, according to which local problem-solving is seen as a preferred tool to more effective interventions (Dasandi et al. 2016). This becomes especially important in contexts with limited statehood such as the countries studied in this issue paper. One prerequisite for local engagement is, however, increased transparency in how the authorities govern resources. The concerned authorities should thus, e.g. be encouraged to improve transparency in decision-making regarding the issuing and revoking of extraction licenses in order to prevent these from functioning as ‘currency’ in privileged clientelistic networks. It is thus recommended that donors continue to provide assistance in compliance with GIABA, EITI and FATF standards in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali and Nigeria.",

As suggested by the IMF (2015), for instance, Malian law enforcement often lacks awareness of money laundering as a criminal endeavour and also lacks training in economic and financial crime detection, investigation and prosecution. Considering that this paper has pointed to the high risk that Malian ASM gold is used for money laundering, tailored measures to capacitate law enforcement in Mali on the matter should be taken (provided due caution is taken) in order to hinder natural resources from being associated with impunity.

Factors such lower export taxes in neighbouring countries can thus create economic incentives for smuggling. Regional efforts and organisations such as ECOWAS can serve as platforms to harmonise regulations in the region and to promote better border control. Such cooperation and harmonisation may serve to limit smuggling as well as to address some of the economic incentives that serve as drivers of the regional illicit trade. In the case of Mali, the loophole in the way in which export tax law is practiced in relation to ASM gold should be closed. This means that tax should be paid on the full amount of gold exported. This measure may help curb the illicit entry of ASM gold from neighbouring countries and control the export of ASM gold from Mali. As Reuters (2017) points out, there are limited prospects for commodity-based money laundering being regulated on a national level in developing countries because of the fact that local elites are often involved in illicit financial flows. Promoting regional efforts may not solve this issue entirely but may point fingers at regimes that avoid taking part in such initiatives. ",

To make it even more problematic, legal and illegal resources can be mixed in gold bars, oil shipments or through hacked timber databases. In addition, there is a trend in commodity trading, especially in mining, for smaller companies to often be involved in resource extraction. These smaller companies are, in general, less concerned about reputational risks and operate under less compliance pressure than larger companies. Issues regarding the forgery of licenses/certifications, combined with the increased role of junior companies, complicate transparency and exacerbate the need for effective due diligence. As pointed out elsewhere, due diligence obligations that are applicable throughout the supply chain, from extraction to consumption, are needed in order to establish greater transparency in the flow of commodities (see, e.g. Berne Declaration 2013). Nevertheless, establishing workable measures to that end may be difficult in practice. The OECD (2017) recently published a report with guidance for meaningful stakeholder engagement in the extractive sector. The report also includes guidance on stakeholder engagement with artisanal/alluvial miners. These guidelines make a healthy starting point for thinking about how to best manage supply chain risks.

In order to achieve this, there is a need for smart approaches that take into account the incentives of MNEs. International monitoring mechanisms need to take into account the conflict of interests that MNEs often face when trading in natural resources emanating from conflict or corruption prone states. Ensuring regulation that does not shield MNEs from public naming and shaming is one important step. Self-regulatory mechanisms could be an additional measure (see, e.g. the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network). These may have the disadvantage of appealing only to big actors who ‘can afford to care’, while leaving other segments of companies to cater to less conscientious clients and thus create a two-tiered market. Self-regulatory measures may nevertheless serve to raise awareness and raise standards of due diligence and facilitate critical inquiry into the business activities of MNEs by outsiders and/or clients. In Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali and Nigeria, there are already platforms for collective action cooperation, such as EITI, which could be further developed to increasingly serve as drivers for improved business practices. In a recent change, EITI now requires oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to governments for each project they operate. This represents an important improvement, which could also impede corrupt transfers for extraction licences. At the same time, however, a vote in the US Congress to overturn the implementation rule (1504) of the Frank Dodd Act represented a step in the opposite direction, as it will make it more difficult for the public to gain insight into the payments of extractive companies for extractive rights.

It could also help close some loopholes that currently facilitate corruption, illegal exploitation, tax evasion and potentially also the financing of illicit activity. One formalising measure could be to establish state-run buying centres for ASM gold. Another would be to enforce stricter regulation of the export system for ASM gold. While formalisation is a political and legal process that can only be decided by Malian authorities, there may be a need for advice on the design of legal measures as well as on the implementation of new regulation. One step in the right direction could be to opt for an assessment to be carried out by the Mining Policy Framework (Mali is already a member of the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals and Sustainable Development, IGF). This process is intended to identify measures for improving mining governance through capacity building and technical support and has reportedly been of use to other countries in the process of reforming their mining sector.",

In order to avoid that formalization processes simply lead to informal trading structures being adapted or reinvented, one should also consider providing education on how to make a living in a licit economy.

Anti-corruption interventions in this sector therefore have the disadvantage of aiming at ‘moving targets’. Building solid understandings of different aspects of how natural resources may help finance other types of illicit and illegal activity is therefore a continuous endeavour that requires constant attention to change. This fluidity generates a near constant need for updated empirical knowledge of how natural resources are illicitly exploited on their way to legal or illegal markets worldwide. However, there are also a few notable and more generic knowledge gaps that should be closed in order to identify ways to prevent lootable natural resources from sponsoring illicit activity. Some of these gaps are identified and summarised in the following section. ",

Diamonds and gold, in particular, have been identified as highly valuable resources that are difficult to trace and, therefore, attractive for money laundering purposes. The FAFT (2013b) has published guidelines to prevent diamonds from being used for money laundering, but there is still a knowledge gap in relation to each of the four contexts studied in this paper. In particular, there is little knowledge of which actors use gold or diamonds for money laundering purposes and how this is done in practice, both locally and internationally. For donors who intend to introduce measures to curb the illicit flow of lootable natural resources into legal markets, understanding the mechanisms and vehicles used for money laundering is key. Learning more about money laundering can, as such, help devise ways to encourage greater transparency in the ways in which natural resources are extracted and traded. This in turn will likely help strengthen the capacity of commercial traders to carry out due diligence and to reduce the risk of becoming complicit in money laundering and potentially sponsoring additional illicit activity. Some have also called for a better understanding of country-level drivers of money laundering in order to make progress on the illicit financial flow agenda (Forstater 2016).",

For instance, how and where are stolen oil products sold internationally? This means that more attention should be paid to understanding the particular value chains of each of the four resources studied in this paper. Some attention has fortunately been devoted to artisanal mining and related value chains. In terms of artisanal gold or diamond mining, there is a fair amount of research emanating from, for example, the literature on human rights/human security, development and the ‘resource curse literature’ (HRW 2011; Schipper, de Haan, & van Dorp 2015; Partnership Africa Canada 2017; Maconachie & Binns 2007). In the case of Mali, this literature seems somewhat detached from the literature on the current conflict in Mali and the disorder in the northern part of the country. This may simply be because there are actually few connections between illegal gold mining and the separatist and terrorist groups operating in the north of the country (FATF-GIABA-GABAC 2016), or it may be due to the difficulty of establishing such connections. Perhaps the most striking ‘gap’ in the literature concerning gold in Mali is, however, related to the state-controlled gold industry. Knowing that corruption is endemic to political and economic life and that Mali possesses large amounts of gold, corruption within the large industrialised gold sector and its potential links to criminal or separatist groups does merit a lot more attention. In both Mali and Sierra Leone, there is a particular need for more knowledge on whether industrially mined minerals (not just artisanal gold or diamonds) are stolen, used to support illicit activity and/or exploited in money laundering schemes.

Licencing and certification schemes often provide a false sense of reliability due to weak oversight mechanisms and their susceptibility to forgery. When licenses and certification schemes are ineffective, there is a need to find solutions to ensure transparency in supply chains. Placing enhanced due diligence requirements on counterparts can be a way for traders to protect themselves against being complicit in illicit trade. However, more knowledge is needed on what exactly works in this respect. Global Witness (2017) found that companies with secret ownership structures held several logging concessions in Liberia. Previous reports, like the Puppet Master report (Van der Does de Willebois et al. 2011) and the Panama Papers (2016), show that secrecy jurisdictions and corporate vehicles are widely used to transfer/hide illicit funds generated from corruption or other forms of criminal activity. Although this is covered in the EITI framework, there is still a need to further examine the use of corporate vehicles, especially due to the number of small actors with complicated ownership structures involved in the trade in lootable resources. There is a need for more knowledge of how to avoid opaque ownership structures in becoming a useful tool to cover up the looting of natural resources ",

For example, China is now a major importer of natural resources from Africa and is often a more significant trading partner than, for example, the EU. China generally has lower documentation requirements concerning origin and natural resource management than many other importers. Often, supply initiatives like the Kimberley Certification and FLEGT stem from the EU and do not necessarily impact trade with countries like China or the UAE. The fact that a major goods manufacturer like China or a trade hub like the UAE maintains lower documentation requirements than other importers causes problems for secondary imports to markets that maintain stricter demands on imports, such as the EU. Diverging requirements increase the risk that manufactured or processed import might stem from illicit trade. Once illegal natural resources are manufactured into products, the origins and value chains of the resources are very difficult to trace by individual companies. This also means that there is a need for more knowledge of ways to better control lootable natural resources, not only at their first stages of the value chain, but also after they have been processed and re-exported.

There is a wide and general knowledge gap relating to anti-corruption reform and what potential effective alternatives to the traditional principal-agent approaches could look like. A proposed solution is to design interventions that are built on local problem-solving and to a greater extent on practical governance realities (Dasandi et al. 2016). However, local solutions are of little help unless they have established an understanding of the incentive structures at work, which are also applicable for local actors and populations, as they are usually not exempt from neo-patrimonial structures and logics. In countries such as the four studied here, corruption should be studied not as a deviation from established governing norms but, rather, as the governance system. While there is a fair amount of research on these systems, they need to be paired more concretely with the anti-corruption knowledge base. In order to address the knowledge gap of ‘what works’ in these types of systems, there is a need for more research to understand the interests and incentives of political settlements. A possible starting point would be to study existing informal structures like the Open Yai markets in Sierra Leone. From a practical perspective, doing this would require more in-depth and holistic approaches, especially to avoid the unintended consequences of creating a system that might further entrench corruption.

This is especially relevant for interventions in complicated neo-patrimonial social structures. Building a more systematised knowledge based on cases that failed to have the desired effect would enable decision-makers to make more informed choices when designing interventions. While there is of course a need to avoid sweeping generalisations, a greater focus on what did not work could help advance the research field by enabling researchers to more systematically pinpoint key variables and combinations of variables, which may provide the best (or worst) potentials for different types of interventions. Learning from negative examples is usually a challenge in most policy fields, as failures are not published as widely as (moderate) success stories. In this respect, there may also be something to learn from the concept of ‘adaptive management’ within the field of development. While this is not an entirely new or widely accepted concept, it recognises that when dealing with complex challenges, iterative and adaptive approaches that are mindful of what seems not to have worked may be useful. Adaptive approaches that allow space for incremental learning may still not be dominant within the development field, but they could nevertheless serve to inspire less fixed approaches to learning within other fields. The United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DfID has applied adaptive management to two major programmes, the State Accountability and Voice Initiative (SAVI) a demand-side good governance project in Nigeria, and Legal Assistance for Economic Reform (LASER), a climate reform programme implemented in eight countries (Derbyshire & Donovan 2016). The initial evaluation indicates that implementation was successful, although it demands significant operational and technical expertise (ibid). Gaining more knowledge on what this means in practice when designing interventions aimed at hindering West African natural resources from being looted, exploited by corrupt officials and even used to finance other illicit activity could be beneficial.

The country is mineral rich in general, and iron ore and coltan are becoming increasingly important to the economy. A recent case study by Hunter and Smith (2017) argues that the artisanal gold mining sector is also becoming increasingly important, primarily due to the scarcity of alluvial diamonds. There is, however, a general natural resource management issue in the country, which means that focusing exclusively on improving the governance of diamonds may help create opportunities for the exploitation of other resources.

Estimates from 2007 show that the formal logging sector provided direct employment for between 7,000–10,000 people in Liberia (Altman & Woods 2012). During the civil war, and in its immediate aftermath, logging for household and commercial purposes led to estimated losses of 33,000 hectares per year, and in 2005, approximately 4.5 million hectares remained (ibid). Despite the depletion of forests during the civil war and its aftermath, logging is still considered a major source of income for the government.",

Thus, they have built these websites, enabled by open/free source software, and have targeted government email addresses. These portals allow users to not only issue requests by accessing just one site – no matter the agency or topic – but also without having to search for email addresses. Further, these portals usually present a feature of proactive disclosure of all responses in order to allegedly improve the efficiency of the procedure allowing users to monitor requests, as well as setting up a knowledge repository where all requests are centralised. As more portals are set up, a pertinent question for all these portals relates to the relationship between these portals and the actual improvement of RTI regimes, as well as the dissemination of the exercise of the right to access information."

Next, we analyse each of our cases following a comparative framework that we have developed. We then discuss the role of requesters, government and enforcement institutions. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations to donors and other organisations based on our cases and the available literature. We argue that portals play a meaningful, but limited, role in improving RTI regimes. We note that the sustainability of these initiatives requires new ways of understanding the role of civic tech organisations in RTI regimes. We draw attention to the fact that without these portals, some of the positive changes in these RTI regimes would not have materialised."

Despite this increase in numbers, there is consensus that implementation of these laws across the globe has been poor in many cases (Darbishire 2010, Hazell, Worthy and Glover 2010, Fumega, Lanza and Scrollini 2013). In short, while passing a RTI law is an important step, it is far from being sufficient for a successful RTI regime.

They are the foundation for RTI regimes or arenas (Scrollini 2015), where several actors interplay to access and use public information. Conflicts and disagreements about who gets the information, when, and how, are common in these information arenas, but there are several ways in which government and other actors could manage this conflict. Nonetheless, in order to understand how these regimes work, it is necessary to consider factors such as the emergence of these regimes, the professionalism of public bureaucracy and the role RTI enforcement institutions play."

Through this portal, a user can access information that was previously requested -and for which a satisfactory response has been given- without having to re-file the same request. There is a rationale behind publishing this information: the INAI understands that when information is requested, it is not just for an individual to access a particular piece of information, but rather a request for that information to be made public; this is why both the requests and the responses are regarded as public. In Chile, on the other hand, the portal of the Council for Transparency only allows the request and the response to be seen by the user who filed it. This is because the portal’s information system cannot differentiate which parts of the request and the response should be classified as private or sensitive information, and which should be public. Therefore, responsibility is entrusted to the agency involved (Fumega 2014)."

The Uruguayan law is progressive (Centre for Law and Democracy and Access Info-Europe 2015) as it includes the whole of the public sector and a public interest test. Further, it allows individual requests for any kind of information, the only requisite for which is to have a written request following basic specifications. However, the law does not set an independent oversight public body. As a result, the implementation of the RTI law – eight years after its enactment – shows challenges in terms of proactive transparency, request procedures and resolution for conflicts (Scrollini 2015). One of the main challenges in the early days of RTI was to make citizens aware of the law. Another challenge was to simplify request mechanisms so requesters could ask for information in an efficient and simple way."

Concurring with Bailur and Longley (2014), developing and implementing a portal (in particular an open source, civil society one) is a radical act. To further explore the value of these portals, we might need to understand more about their specific advantages over government portals or other ways of requesting information. To judge success (or lack of success) of a project, it is important to understand the objectives these portals establish at the beginning of their design. In all the selected case studies, portals were developed with the aim of changing a given RTI regime. This overarching goal was, to varying degrees of success, achieved and the level of success depended on the resources and status of the RTI regime."

Through this portal, a user can access information that was previously requested -and for which a satisfactory response has been given- without having to re-file the same request. There is a rationale behind publishing this information: the INAI understands that when information is requested, it is not just for an individual to access a particular piece of information, but rather a request for that information to be made public; this is why both the requests and the responses are regarded as public. In Chile, on the other hand, the portal of the Council for Transparency only allows the request and the response to be seen by the user who filed it. This is because the portal’s information system cannot differentiate which parts of the request and the response should be classified as private or sensitive information, and which should be public. Therefore, responsibility is entrusted to the agency involved (Fumega 2014)."

  "lead": "Over the past two decades, advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have transformed the way people access and interact with the information that governments produce and hold. The development of online platforms, which enable users to submit requests for information under right to information legislation (RTI), is one of many examples of these changes. This paper presents an analytic framework to explore how RTI online portals impact RTI regimes, while reviewing the experience of five civil society portals in developing and developed countries. We argue that these civil society-led portals have affected in a positive way these RTI regimes. However, further research about the influence of these platforms (and the whole RTI regime) in transparency and accountability is needed.",

    "Civil society RTI portals can positively influence the way public RTI oversight institutions function",
    "The portals enabled a new type of civil society actor to emerge. Donors could consider supporting these types of projects to encourage the further development of this new type of organisation",
    "Supporting dialogue between NGOs and government in developing official portals can ensure that citizen-oriented logic is maintained in official RTI portals"
